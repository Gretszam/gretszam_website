    <h1 class="center">Me? Well it's kind of a long story... </h1>
    <p>Yes it's me, Gretszam Zabek.

    <p>I know I know, you're honored to be in my presence. Yes, I am the daughter of THE Dr. Z.

    <p> My personality is...spontaneous to say the least. I'm a loud and energetic person. I will yell at strangers that their dogs are beautiful and wonderful pups. I have a pupper myself. His name is Lucky. He's a mix of a Minipoodle and Russian Terrier with 3% Golden Retriever. My personal goals for my academic year is to maintain a 4.0 gpa. I am in love with Mrs. Deamer's cheese that she brings in on drama set build days. I love playing DnD (Dungeons and Dragons). It's super exciteing and is unbelievably fun. I play with a couple of friends and our epic DM (please spare me Kevin). I'm very into looking a dogs and intricate and ornate clothing. My favorite season is Fall, but it is increasngly cold and windy. I enjoy coloring and being ith my friends is a wonderful pastime. However, drinking tea, being wrapped up in a blanket, and watching Netflix or Youtube is far supeior.

    <p> I <em> love </em> penguins. They are my favorite animal and seriously look at them they are frikkin adorable. Penguins are the best no cap. Reading is also something I thourghly enjoy. It introduces me to new worlds and immerses me in the charactrs and stories books illutrate. Through reading ypu can lean to understand others in inceasingly new ways and to view the world hrough endless lenses.
