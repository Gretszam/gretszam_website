    <h1 class="center">Me? Well it's kind of a long story... </h1>
    <p>It's a me, Gretszam Bernadette Zabek.</p>
    <p> My personality is...spontaneous to say the least. I'm a loud and energetic person.
        <br>I will yell at strangers that their dogs are beautiful and wonderful pups.
        <br> I have a pupper myself. His name is Lucky. He's a mix of a Minipoodle and Russian
        <br>Terrier with 3% Golden Retriever. My personal goals for my academic year is to
        <br>maintain a 4.0 gpa. I am in love with Mrs. Deamer's cheese that she brings in on
        <br>drama set build days. I love playing DnD (Dungeons and Dragons). It's super
        <br> exciteing and is unbelievably fun. I play with a couple of friends and our epic DM
        <br>(please spare me Kevin). I'm very into looking a dogs and intricate and ornate
        <br> clothing. My favorite season is Fall, but it is increasngly cold and windy. I enjoy
        <br> coloring and being ith my friends is a wonderful pastime. However, drinking tea,
        <br> being wrapped up in a blanket, and watching Netflix or Youtube is far supeior.
