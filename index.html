    <h1>Me Oh My</h1>
    <p>It's a me, Gretszam Bernadette Zabek.</p>
    <h2> Me? Well it's kind of a long story... </h2>
    <p> My personality is...spontaneous to say the least. I'm a loud and energetic person.
        <br>I will yell at strangers that their dogs are beautiful and wonderful pups.
        <br> I have a pupper myself. His name is Lucky. He's a mix of a Minipoodle and Russian
        <br>Terrier with 3% Golden Retriever. My personal goals for my academic year is to
        <br>maintain a 4.0 gpa. I am in love with Mrs. Deamer's cheese that she brings in on
        <br>drama set build days. Louie has the best hair and looks absolutely adorable with
        <br>a hair clip. Very good to shoot through. Twice. He is very good tolerating me and
        <br> entertaing me. Lota facial hair. 6th grade Louie was frikkin adorable and sweet
        <br>little baby face. Human pup.
