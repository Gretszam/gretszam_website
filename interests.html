    <h2>Theater</h2>
    <p>I really enjoy doing theater. I am part of the drama productions that are at San Rafael High School and the drama club (who is now run by Andrew Herold and Austin Graff). You should totaly come check out our productions, they are all written by these amazing people! If I'm not up there on stage performing you can bet your behind I'm helping out behind the scenes. Theater is a fantastic way to meet new people and an amazing medium to express yourself. It is unbelievably fun. I am not a good singer by any means, but being part of ensemble (the people who dance and sing and aren't the main characters) is an incredible experience and an absolute blast. Though it's a lot, and I mean a LOT, of work it's a great way to exercise and enjoy yourself at the same time. Not to mention the Drama Set Build Days are a fantastic way to spend the day. You're painting, building, finding costumes, and a how slew of many other things with entertainging people and friends. Plus Mrs. Deamer brings her cheese. Beleive me, this woman has the ultimate cheese knowlegde. </p>
    <p><b><u>BONUS:</u></b> I get to be with friends.
