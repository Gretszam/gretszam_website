    <h2>Theater</h2>
    <p>I really enjoy doing theater. I am part of the drama productions that are
        <br>at San Rafael High School and the drama club (who is now run by Andrew
        <br>Herold and Austin Graff). You should totaly come check out our productions,
        <br>they are all written by these amazing people! If I'm not up there on stage
        <br>performing you can bet your behind I'm helping out behind the scenes.
        <br>Theater is a fantastic way to meet new people and an amazing medium to
        <br>express yourself. It is unbelievably fun. I am not a good singer by any means,
        <br>but being part of ensemble (the people who dance and sing and aren't the
        <br>main characters) is an incredible experience and an absolute blast.
        <br>Though it's a lot, and I mean a LOT, of work it's a great way to
        <br>exercise and enjoy yourself at the same time.</p>
    <p><b>BONUS:</b> I get to be with friends.
